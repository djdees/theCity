A chantry founded by a cabal that not only had a sense of humor, but were fans of the original Sherlock Holmes. Over time, two more small cabals formed as new folks joined and grouops formed around differing interests. The material presence of their building is actually on Baker Street. The space below them occupied by an artisan bakery. Only connected to a small node, the  membership was kept very small on purpose. Through several generations, members of the three small cabals have worked to two ends. 

The first end, is the preservation of knowledge. The largest of the cabals collects and restores books and scrolls. They collect and retrieve whatever they can find to preserve the knowledge of the past. Led by a member of the Order of Hermes tradition, he has been successfuly in bartering knowledge for more knowledge. He has visted other Chantries to preserve or restore works in danger and has a number of contacts. 

The second end, is focused on by the largest of the cabals. It collects seeds from many places. Their seed bank is more than a hundred years old, started long before the current global seed bank. They grow some of what can be grown on site and preserve that they can in their small horizion realm. Having limited space, only a few things can be grown there. They sell and trade with many other places. They grow on differing cycles and may have some very rare plants available for trade. 

Personal contacts are one way to reach them. A reference and a phone number will certainly get you a meeting somewhere in the City with somebody from the chantry. Another way is find the "Urban Jungle" gardening shop. Say the right words, act the right way and a door may open.
