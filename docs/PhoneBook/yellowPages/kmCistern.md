A former drinking water reservoir built in the early 1900s. Lauded at the time for the innovated design of catch basins, water capture, and stunning architecual feature the construction ran well over budget and schedule. Designed by the noted architect Antonio Ricci as one of his first projects after leaving the tutalage of Neils Thorp. Rather than the usual rectangle with pillar construction, the straight lines with obtuse angles were considered cutting edge at flow managment at the time. The ornate pillars of the Greek Revivial Style and the ornamentation give it an odd feeling when the water is low enough that people can access it. Awakened or aware people often report being uncomfortable and attribute it to the cool dampness of the cistern.

The above ground buildings, originally drafted by Torp, were shifted to a Romanesque Revival style. Although they are now long abandoned, parts can still be walked by intrepid explorers. A number of disappearances have been reported, but no evidence of remains have ever been found.
