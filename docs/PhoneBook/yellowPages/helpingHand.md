Funded by distant and remote patrons, the Mission of the Helping Hand does it's best to live up to it's name. Funding is fairly generous and it serves many in the community. The mages associated with the Sept of the Blue Box are active there. Mission services include art and education classes for homeless children, meals for any homeless, and connections to a variety of social services. 

The mission itself is in an older building. The basement, accessible from the street by steps down to an old door has storage, and a large kitchen. The rest of the space is turned over to an eating area during meal times and a place for cots at night. When guests are present, there is always at least one off-duty police officer and several large men to keep order. Theft is not tolerated and will result in being banned. 

The main level holds offices and class rooms. There is help available for a large variety of social services, although it's generally limited to help with forms and referrals to the correct parts of social service or other services. The space is designed to provide a sense of security and there is a light presence of security in place. A few times a year, somebody will get unruly and be asked to leave. Those that are physically or verbally abusive are quickly and firmly dealt with.

The upper levels are a private space. Some of it meeting rooms and some of it rented accomodations.

*For those in the know:*

There is a strong but hidden connection to three different groups of mages. Individuals don't talk about who they're affiliated with and serve to keep the place peaceful and work on subtle types of healing. For those that have accomodations in the upper levels, there is a clear set of rules about keeping "magical" things out of that their space. There is sporadic observation by different branches of the technocracy, usually picked up on right away, but assumed to be constant. This observation is the primary reason for the rules on keeping magical things away. 

Some of the large volunteers in the dining area are members of the Sept of the Blue Box. They hide that they are Garou from both the mages and the mundane population. A number of their community makes use of some of the services and they keep a careful watch for young adults that may be running away from their first change. While theywon't take them directly back to their caern, there are several safe houses set up.

There are two mages that are aware of the garou and are affiliated with the Sept of the Blue Box.

Unknown to each other, there is both a Glasswalker and a Virtual Adept working there. Both have, so far, managed to hide some of the extra work they do to hide the mission from unfriendly eyes or to help somebody in particular need.
