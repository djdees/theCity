It had not been a good night. The three to eleven shift was never predictable. The horrors usually seen by the eleven to seven shift weren't usually out yet. The mundane things of the day shift, seven to three, tapered off by halfway through the shift. As they diminished, the uglier things began to show up. 

She'd hoped for good weather, but it had been nothing be rain for the day and most of the evening. Already, the heavy fog known to all the City residents was showing signs of drifting in early. It would make for hard night for the ambulance drivers. They would push to get to the scene as fast as they could, the low visibility slowing them down. 

She'd hoped to make it home in time to harvest by the light of the full moon. Different projects required several of the herbs in her garden. Just any cutting wouldn't work for those projects and rituals. Harvested by cold iron and the light of a full moon gave them the power and spiritual flavor they needed. The stubborn clouds completely covered the sky, like the quilt blanket her grandmother had made covered her bed. 

She still didn't have a car, but one of the emergency room nurses offered a lift. There had been a lot of problems at bus stops, even by the hospital lately. The working girls were staying close to the lights and the buildings, they didn't talk to her much. She had stopped at one of the diners down near the docks for mid-shift coffee. She'd heard several of them talking about a warning they'd been given. Something in the alleyways. Something with a sharp knife and a fondness for easy prey, wondering if it would come back again. She wondered if she'd be seeing any of them at work or on the street, cut and bleeding out.

The worst had been the sanitation crew. They'd been down in the sewers and somebody got badly hurt. She couldn't imagine what would have torn almost all the meat off a leg like that. No teeth had marked the bone, and there wasn't much they could do. She fingered the antique stethoscope her grandmother had given her as a good-bye gift. It had been her focus for checking for the life around her and to help her pump life into others where she could. Between what she had been able to do and getting him to the hospital in time, he'd live. He wouldn't walk again, but he'd live. 

She'd sensed something, something odd off in the distance. It had felt big. Big and hungry. 

She walked into her garden through the gate she'd added. She noted fog already accumulating in the corners and lower spots. No lights were on in the house, it was obvious that her tenant wasn't home either. Or, she thought to herself, passed out again. In fairness, he'd been clean for a while, but she'd seen many relapses and always wondered when he would. 

Taking a small flashlight off her purse, she began digging for keys. A flicker of motion in the shadows caught her eye. Turning, she could see glowing eyes staring. She jumped, startled. She reached for her can of mace. The light of the flashlight showed the eyes of a dozen cats. Focusing on them, she realized that they were Judas's cats. All except the oldest one, all lined up on the fence. Another glimpse of motion and the oldest one joined the line up. 

The cats ignored her, all gazing intently at a back corner of the garden. She knew that that corner held the old gate. She also knew that she'd sealed that gate, nailing it securely closed. She'd found it propped open too many times. That had been several weeks ago.

Her eyes widened and she tensed as she saw a flicker of a deeper, darker, black in the corner. A flash of white drew a gasp. A short slender figure with a pale face hidden under the brim of a top hat. As small shafts of moonlight slid through the clouds, she realized it was her tenant. 

"Judas?" she called quietly, not wanting to draw attention from anybody that might be out. 

He continued on, ignoring her. As he moved into the light of the porch, the old fashioned black suit he wore became obvious. He had a top hat on his head, a cane in one hand, and a large, black leather portfolio case in the other. He presented a dapper, but old-fashioned appearance.

She shivered as a cold damp breeze caressed the back of her neck. 

"Judas." she called, more forcefully. 

Again, he ignored her. Normally he was quick to respond, his behavior concerned. More concerning was his clothing. She knew she had taken that suit away, placed it in a bag and sealed it behind wards. As an additional step, she'd not told him where she put it. She was fairly sure, he'd never found the entrance to the crawl space. She was also sure that he'd not gotten the key to the ward she'd put on the door. 

She started to follow him up the steps to the house, but the motion of the cats leaping from the fence distracted her. Looking back, he was out of sight already. She realized that while she'd heard his footsteps on the porch, she'd not heard the door. He couldn't have made it either end of the house or off the porch without her hearing him. Another oddity in the surreal experience.

Trying to enter the house, she failed. Defeated momentarily by a locked door. It opened easily to her key. As she moved in, she saw Judas standing in front of the large mirror where she'd found him a few weeks before. She reached to the side table and turned the small lamp on.

"Hello-o-o-o-o Judas." she called. 

Visibly blinking and looking around before realizing where he was, he turned to look at her.

"Are you ok?" she asked, "You haven't responded to my calling your name."

Blinking again, he said, "Haven't we been here before? In these spots with these words?"

She paused, thinking back, her words, were the same as last time. 

"Almost," she replied, "The words are almost the same, but you didn't reek of cigars and you weren't carrying your case."

"This, this isn't my case." he replied.

"No? Then whose? Why are you back in that suit?" she continued. 

Visibly, he thought about it. He did smell of cigars, but he didn't taste cigar residue in his mouth. 

"It's for my client, I think I was doing some work for somebody." he said, "The suit was just ... on."

"Did you have to wear it? How did you get it from where I put it?" she asked.

"It was just on. I didn't get it, I was just wearing it." he said.

She examined him. Again, the aura was calm, almost peaceful. His eyes were clear, pupils looked good. His aura didn't show the mess of an active user. 

She thought for a moment. "Can you tell me who your client was?"

"No, but he'll collect the work when I"m done. I think it's supposed to be a gift for somebody." Judas replied. 

"How will you collect the payment, if you don't know who it's for?" she continued.

"I'm not getting paid cash." Judas said, bending down to take his shoes off,"I'll be owed a favor. When I need to collect, I'll know."

This was weird, this was concerning. She wondered, not for the first time, what he had gotten into and if he knew what it was, how dangerous it could be.

Finally, she sighed. Then she sighed again, Grandma never said there would be days like this. This type of interaction was beyond her knowledge and experience. There should always be a clear deal. Value for value.

Moving up the stairs, Judas turned and asked, "Are you wanting to try to ward the suit away again?"

She thought for a moment, then replied, "I"ll give it another try, but not until the morning. It was a lousy shift and I'm tired."

Judas continued up the stairs, passing out of sight. She stood there, for a few more minutes. She moved over to the side of the hall where he had left his portfolio. She didn't recognized the dark leather. It was not cowhide, nor any other animal she recognized. Even finished, its texture was rough and harsh. She'd never felt sharkskin, but she couldn't see getting such a large, perfect piece of it. There was a clear pattern worked into it, around the edges and creating designs. The black on black patterns were hard to see in the dim light in the hallway. 
Finally giving in to her curiosity, she moved the case to the light and opened it. Inside there was a half-finished canvas. A grinning skull with wire glasses and a top hat looked at her. It sat on top of a tall, skinny body clad in an old fashioned suit. In one hand, a light cigar. In the background a strange design covered the lid of a coffin.

Without her thoughts guiding them, she slid the canvas back in and closed the case. Re-positioning it to the side of the hallway, she retreated to her room and her thoughts.
