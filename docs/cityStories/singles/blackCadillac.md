It didn't register the first time. Which is odd, given how many first times he remembered. He'd come back from somewhere in the Umbra. Off with a large group of werewolves. He'd been asked to go by the local Grandfather, a title of importance to the tribe he associated with. It wasn't his first trip, nor his second. He thought he was more prepared and ready. He'd thought wrong. He'd never been on a hunting trip before. He'd also never been bait quite like that before either. He still didn't know what most of the things killed really were, although they were all ugly and dangerous.

He hadn't parked close to the junkyard most of them called home. That was asking for trouble, even for an older, beat up looking car. Seeing the pouring rain that started after they came back through the barrier, he'd sighed. Then he sighed again and started walking. The commotion of the celebratory party would be too much for him. He wanted a bath, not a shower, a bath. He didn't think a shower could get all of the bodily fluids he's been covered in off him. The rain might, but it was cold, very cold. He was not looking forward to the long walk ahead of him. He figured it was six blocks to where he'd stashed his car.

He'd gone barely a hundred feet when he came across his car. At first he didn't think it was his, but he'd never seen another car on the streets that matched the vintage of his ride. He didn't see the familiar bad paint and dents, but in the dim street light, he could easily read the plates. They matched his vanity plates. His key worked in the lock, although it was unneeded. He checked the back seat, nothing there. He'd learned the hard way that there were things that went bump in the night. They also bit, chewed, ripped and tore through people. The inside of the car was warm and dry. He headed home.

The next time, it was after a long meeting over an art project. Some funding was there, but it barely covered the cost of materials. A small office and smaller minded people. He figured he would be walking away from it, happy to have not sunk more than a little time into sketches. Night had fallen, which made him nervous. He'd come down during the business day, but this had run way long. Dark had fallen early and a cold bitter wind was cutting through his thin coat. He also didn't have more than a large flashlight in his satchel. He knew he could turn it into a weapon. The dark and cold, on top of the probably failed deal, further sapped his spirit. 

Leaving the entry way, he made it partway down the block. There in the street light was a black Cadillac. A familiar black Cadillac. He paused, checked the plates. They matched his. Again, door unlocked, warm inside. Tired and fuzzy, he drove home and went to bed.

This went on for a while. It didn't always happen. There were lots of times that his car was right where he remembered leaving it. Often, though, it was right where he needed it, when he needed it there. For some reason, it never registered as odd. Just a string of good luck and not paying attention.

It had been a bad weekend. One of his regular "girls" had been badly beaten and then shot up with something. He'd found her, beaten and raving. With the Sweetie's help, he'd gotten an ambulance there, despite the late hour and bad neighborhood. He'd ridden in with her and waited until he heard she'd survive. The ER nurse he'd spoken with said that they didn't know what had been shot into her, but it was clear she hadn't done it herself. He'd known that, no junkie shoots up through the neck nor do they leave the needle in. He was hungry like he hadn't been in years. He'd missed lunch, but hurried out anyway. There was word on the street of some strange things going on. He'd connected with Nate to collect a small box. He'd been wanting something for emergencies, what better than a six-pack of extinct dinosaurs. He very much want a ride in their blimp, but wasn't quite brave enough to ask. Then he'd stopped by for dinner at the diner, but word of a beating going on had him moving before he ordered more than water. No supper either. Then the ER. 

He wasn't quite ready to whine about it, even to himself. He didn't have much cash, so a cab was out. He figured his best option was the bus. He was halfway to the bus, when he passed an old black Cadillac parked by a street light. He paused. He checked the plates, his again. Now his attention was caught. He knew he hadn't parked the Cadillac any where near where it was now. He knew he hadn't even taken it out of the garage when he left this morning.

He approached it cautiously. He checked the back seat, nothing. He opened the trunk, only the box the cats came in and a jack were there. He leapt back, nothing had reached out from underneath to get him. He checked with the flashlight, nothing hiding underneath the car.

He carefully opened the driver's door. No explosions, always good. No signs of tampering or hot wiring. He carefully slid into the seat. The car was warm on the chilly night. The car started easily, his favorite station playing quietly. He glanced at the passenger seat. A cardboard box sat there. Square and flat, a small bag sitting beside it. He reached up, to flip the light on, to look at it, forgetting he'd not put a new bulb in the overhead. 

"Remember," he said to himself, "It's not paranoia if they are out to get you."

Sliding the flashlight out of his satchel, he flicked it on and looked at the box. The top of the box had a cartoonish guy in a chef's hat and text that read "East Side Pizza".

"What the fuck?" he said out loud.
