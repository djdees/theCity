Things had started out badly. A quick run through the moon paths had
been forcefully redirected by an umbral storm. The group had managed
to stay together and the landing was rough. As the disorientation
cleared, the surrounding realm began to register. Sun burnt fields and
a clear sky seemed a fair start. Nothing stood out as an immediate
danger. A dirt road was underfoot and the path was bordered by
hedgerows. In the distance, a crossroad could be seen.

Judas trudged along behind Vincent. Quickly, he began to fall behind
as Vincent's powerful frame and greater endurance carried him forward.
Judas slowly caught up as Vincent paused to check a sign at the
crossroads. Several roads met at the small junction. Judas noticed
Vincent had a concerned look on his face as he began to scan the
surroundings with sharp darting glances. A closer look at the sign
showed a number of seemingly unrelated names - "Ardennes, Somme,
Bastone, Chosin, Incheon, and Seoul".

"I don't get it, where are we?" asked Judas. "Some of those names look
like French, but I now Seoul is in Korea."

"This is bad," replied Vincent, "we're in a realm."

"I still don't get it, why is that bad? We're not being blown around."
said Judas.

"Because those are battles, all battles from different times and
places. We're in the battlefield realm." Vincent stated, "There's
something that connects all those, but I can't think of what."

  <Judas starts to panic - need to describe that.>

A whistling noise begins to get louder and louder. Vincent grabs Judas
and pulls him in to a deep mud-filled ditch in front of a thick
hedgerows.

"What the hell?" screams Judas, just as a series of loud explosions begins.

"Artillery, that's what those battles have in common." Vincent yelled
over the noise.

As Judas began to panic in earnest, the noise and explosions grew in
frequency and intensity.

< Describe a long scramble through muddy ditches ending in trenches.
Reinforce the unremitting and constant rain of artillery.>

Judas wasn't sure when they had moved from the muddy ditch, all sense
of time and direction has quickly vanished as he frantically followed
Vincent's scramble to escape the molten rain. They'd both run from a
set of shells that emitted clouds of a green choking gas and at some
point Vincent had shifted to the in-between form. He'd ripped through
a couple groups of soldiers. The uniforms had not helped identify
where they really were. He'd heard German, French, and English shouted
and screamed at different points. A ringing bugle and whistles had
preceded the sounds of an oriental language a couple of corners later.

Eyes burning, ears ringing, Judas was slammed against a wooden door
after a near miss. Vincent had been picked up and thrown against the
muddy trench wall. The door, half smashed from an earlier shell,
opened on a narrow wooden stair going down. The heavy rain of shells
seemed to get heavier as Vincent pushed Judas aside to head down into
the shelter, pulling him behind as he tried to check for soldiers in
the chamber below.

The dimly lit chamber was full of shadows cast by a small lantern
hanging from the ceiling. Boxes of ammunition, empty ration cans and
rats filled the small room. The beams holding up the ceiling creaked
and grown as the muffled thumps of the artillery continued on. Dirty
bunks lined the walls and there was an old Victrola record player on
the floor.

As the Victrola wound down, the sound of shouting came down the
stairs. As Vincent readied himself to fight again, Judas noticed a
small door partially covered by a fallen cabinet. A quick look, showed
a flight of stairs heading up.

"C'mon, let's get out of here!" Judas said, tugging on the back of
Vincent's shirt.

Vincent shrugged him off, "There's nowhere to go, try to defend
your-self this time."

His scorn for Judas' helplessness was clear in his tone.

"No, man, there's a door and stairs over here, they head away from the
other set."

The first grenade down the step was a dud and the two used the
opportunity to duck through the small door.

As they climbed the steps, the sound of another grenade detonating
rang from behind them. As they climbed though, the shouting and gun
fire faded. Light was lost after a couple of turns.

"Listen." Vincent said quietly.

Judas paused, "What? I don't hear anything."

"That's right," Vincent replied, "but our footsteps sound different."

Judas cautiously reached down, feeling the ground under his feet.

"Its brick, but we were climbing wooden steps." he observed.

"That means we've moved again, but to where?" mused Vincent.
