This collection is about one of the PCs who was run by the first player to drop out of the campaign. Gillian was her second character and, from my perspective, more usable. However, I didn't give the character enough screen time, and she wasn't well suited to the sandbox style that years later I realized I was running. Add that to poor connections between the other PCs and, well, not a recipie for happiness. 

In the now, where things are still being written, Gillan hasn't faded completely from memory. Although she was not well documented, the bits that are remembered and new bits that will be grafted on, these stories are slowly surfacing from the depths of my mind.
