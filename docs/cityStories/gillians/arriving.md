â€‹
A chill wind blew down the street, shifting and stirring the fallen autumn leaves. Rain hadn't fallen yet, but the swollen, sullen clouds promised that it would. The street was quiet, some asleep, but most gone. Old houses in long rows, all needing something. Lawn care, painting, general repairs were all needed in varying degrees. The size of the houses told of past wealth. Current wealth was conspicuous in its absence.

An old panel van moved slowly down the street. It pulled up to the front walk of a larger two story house. The dirty glass of a sun room could been seen on the southern side. The steeply pitched roof with large dormers, each with many small panes of glass, showed the age of the house. They hinted at a large space, either for storage or living.

After the van parked, an older man moved quickly from behind the driver's seat to open the door for the passenger. A young woman slid out of the van and onto the concrete of the sidewalk. She moved slowly, as if exhaustion had pulled her down into the depths of sleep. Her hastily pulled back hair and the dark rings under her eyes spoke to her state of exhaustion.

"Come miss," the man said, "We've arrived. You're needed for the opening."

The odd couple moved up the walk and through the gate. On edge of the steps of the front porch, they paused. The man opened the small satchel he bore and removed a box. He presented it to her.

"First, the key to the wards, then the key to the house." he quietly instructed.

"Yes, Gilbert, I remember." she replied.

With an ornate key in her hand, she used a sharp point on the tip of the key to prick her finger. Speaking too quietly to be heard, she smeared some of the blood onto a flat rock partially buried in the flower bed. The wind picked up, sighing loudly in the trees of the front lawn. The first sounds of rain could be heard, barely, over the distant noise of city traffic.

They moved up the steps, she unlocked the door and pushed it open. Moving aside, she allowed Gilbert to move into the house first. He quickly moved through the rooms on the main level. Covered furniture filled the rooms, faded paint covered the walls. Dust and grime formed into thick layers and streaks on the windows and floors. With a deep sigh, she sank onto one of the benches in the hallway, uncaring that she was making a clean spot. She could hear Gilbert moving through the house, first going up to the upper levels, then down into the basement.

"All seems secure, miss." he reported, "No signs of vermin, no signs of intruders. The wards seemed to have kept both out. Although, I'd wager the kids of the neighborhood talk of this as a haunted house."

"Rest here, for a moment. I'll bring in your things, the rain will be here and you'd catch your death of a cold. Your gran would never forgive me." he continued.

Shrugging her shoulders into a determined set, she replied, "No, we will bring in my things. Your list is long and you have a long way to go. I'm at home, whatever that really means."

Walking out to the van, he said, "Don't despair. I don't know what you saw, when you and your grandmother sought for knowledge, but I know you got an answer. Both the Goddess and Father Oak answered."

"Hints," she said, "hints and directions, nothing clear. A chance, a trace, no more."

"That," he replied, "is the most we've had since the Homestead fell and the little one was taken. I wish it wasn't clear that this was for you to do, that we could help."

In a firmer tone, she responded, "You are helping, so you don't bear the traces of power that Grandmother and I do, your organization and planning saved most when they came. It got us out, it's getting us scattered and settled into places we can recover in and grow strong again."

"Not it," he shook his head, "There's much I wouldn't have thought of without the foresight of your great-gran. She saw the need, if not the when. She knew a daughter would come back to this place that her mother fled from. I'd be happier knowing what she fled and that you'd be safe."

She quietly laughed, "You're the one that taught me safety and learning are not often found in the same place. What did you say? The hard, painful lessons are ones that stick?"

He laughed, "Well, we've learned a lot then, these last months."

Their conversation continued in quiet tones, tasks completed as the rain began to fall in hard sheets.

The kitchen wiped down, the pilot light in the old stove lit. As a pot of water came to a boil, he broke the silence that had fallen.

"Accounts are set up, you've the bank information and some cash in the box. There's not much, but it will get you started. I'll be gone once the tea is ready. The instructions are clear. Restore the property, house and grounds. Make it a refuge for those I or others from the coven bring you. Make it ready, in case. Your gran told me to tell you to learn as well. I've placed a box of books in the library to get you started. Both your gran and your great-gran spoke of this city as a place overlooked by most, but dangerous in it's own way. Neither of them spoke of their time here. I know your gran never lived here, only passed through a few times and your great-gran only spoke of what her mother had said. Be careful, be wary."

She nodded, readying herself to be more alone than she'd ever been. Gilbert had been a large part of her life as a young girl. Even as a young adult she had relied on his insight and advice. He'd held her that terrible night she'd lost her father and he'd held her the only night worse when her daughter was lost, taken in the fall of her home. His absence was already felt, even as he reminded her of old lessons.

The kettle boiled, the teapot filled with water and leaves. The rich aroma of her grandmother tea blend filled the kitchen, transforming it to her senses. Two cups filled, a ceramic mug in plain white for her, a traveling cup for him. They said their goodbyes.

"Be strong," he said, "You are stronger and more gifted than you know. Be awake, be aware. The hand of the Goddess is all around, you just have to look. Danger is too, for us, but it will find you. Looking is not needed. Tend your home, tend your land, tend yourself. The signs will lead you on."

She nodded, done with words for a time. She stood in the rain, realizing he'd left her his umbrella, as she waved goodbye. As the van rounded the corner, she watched the rain. After a few moments, the wind picked up and she moved back inside. The list of things to do starting to fill her mind. Moving back into the kitchen, she picked up her cup of tea.

Suddenly, she smiled. A plate of her favorite cookies was on the table. It hadn't been before she left.

*Gillian, a small treat for you, as you sit to think and plan. Enjoy, then get to work. - Gilbert.*

A reminder, she thought, that even those without power can have a magic of their own.
