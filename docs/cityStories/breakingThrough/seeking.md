John groaned as the light hit his eyes. He barely remembered making it home before collapsing. The chase through the umbra had taken it's toll. Fleeing the security guards, called when he exited through a mirror in a women's bathroom, finished him off. Sighing in disgust, he took in the odor he was putting off and groaned again as he realized he'd collapsed on his bed. Now he had to do laundry too. 

"When," he thought, "did I start to accumulate so much stuff." He gazed around the room. There wasn't much in it, but for a man that had spent most of his life living out of a backpack, it seemed like a lot. Sighing, he began the process of cleaning himself, then his space up. 

After a long hot shower and a change of clothes, he headed for a washeteria. He started the washers, then walked across the street to a small restaurant. He could smell the slow cooking meat. Taking a moment, he savored the sounds of Middle Eastern languages. He'd grown up in Cairo listening to them. He asked for a large gyro and some sliced goat meat. The man behind the counter laughed at him and admonished him in Greek for trying Arabic first. John realized he was easing into being a regular, another oddity for a wandering man. Taking his food, he went back to watch his laundry spin in constrained circles. He took a moment to place some food for Rat's children and scatter something for Cockroach's brood as well. The other patrons faded from his attention as he let his mind wander. 

Memories of his original mentor teaching him about meditation drifted through his mind. Lessons about how to use it to keep in touch with both his active and subconscious minds. His conversation with the gaffling the night before started to come into focus. He realized that something had been off about the conversation. Something was odd, his thoughts circled, picking at it. The answer refused to surface though. There, but out of reach, on the tip of his tongue. Something in the tone or in the words.

Realizing that the washers had finally stopped, he moved things to the dryer. He slowly fed in the required coins, listening to them trickle into the machine. An odd click caught his wandering attention. He looked at the coin return. He’d placed the small metal pendant he’d found in the tangle of rose bushes last night. In the harsh light of the washeteria, it’s age was visible. Most of the haloed head of the figure stamped on it had faded away. He contemplated the words, “Sancti Stephani”. As the dryers started up, he headed back to the eatery for another helping. It had been a while since he’d been this hungry, but the long run hadn’t left him much time for eating. He wasn’t in the mood for eating at the junkyard and the this place had the best gyros he’d had on this side of the Atlantic. The goat was pretty good too. Wandering back in, the counter-man called a greeting in Arabic.

"Back already?" the counter-man asked, "You not get enough earlier?"

"Nah, been on the road for a while, not keeping up with meals." John replied in the same language.

His order given, a to-go container was quickly filled. The man placed a small piece of wax paper, several loukoumades wrapped in it, in the to-go container with the rest of his meal.

"Did you give me the wrong order?" John asked, noticing the addition. 

"No, my friend," the counter-man responded, "Just a little welcome home gift."

"Thanks," John replied, "Yours are far better than my mothers and the thought is appreciated."

John turned to head out, but paused a moment. A fragment of conversation drifted through his hearing. It was Greek, but not quite the Greek he’d learned growing up. He noticed two men in rumpled suits talking loudly, arguing over something. Looking back, he saw the counter-man watching them with look of resignation. The man’s hands were fixing two large cups of Turkish coffee. The counter-man handed the cups and a rag to the waitress. She headed over to the table. Just before she arrived, the wildly gesturing men knocked over their cups of coffee, breaking up the argument. She quickly wiped up the mess and provided the fresh cups of coffee. She admonished the apologetic men and returned to her normal circuit. The counter-man noticed John watching and smiled.

"Professors, always arguing over the dead and gone." he said.

Curiosity piqued, John asked "I couldn't quite follow them, what were they arguing about?"

"No surprise, they never bothered with modern Greek, they speak the old Greek. I don't follow it either, but they both teach up at the big school. They'll be back tomorrow frantically writing, they do this every few weeks." was the reply. 

John shook his head, for most of the street folks, the big school was the college in town. Not a big school, but lots of off-beat degrees. Figuring his dryer would be almost done, he made his good-byes and headed across the street. 

Mechanically, he folded his laundry. His hands moved in patterns that his mind didn't even remember. Thoughts of the place he grew up in and the aunt that taught him to fold his own clothes for travel. She'd been a school teacher and spent as much time educating him in practical tasks as she did in languages. Shifting things in his backpack, he passed the small English and Arabic dictionaries that she'd given him. Smiling, he remembered her saying, "To know a word, you must know where it comes from, both what it meant and what means. Old folks and spirits, they don't always mean what you might think, unless you know the words."

Shouldering his bag, he left the washeteria. He headed back to the squat he’d been using. An older part of town that gentrification hadn’t found yet. Thinking about where he was, he laughed to himself. Gentrification most likely would never find most of the city. He had a dry place to sleep and a door he could lock to keep things out. The shower, that was a bonus. He hadn’t gone so native that he did not want that on a very regular basis. Some of the gnawers crossed the line from street person to ascetics.

His errands done, he let himself into his temporary home. A low key day, many small things had taken care of. He wondered what was happening at the junkyard, but decided that he needed the rest. He needed to think about the bargain he’d made, and how he would go about meeting his end of the deal.

Settling himself into the chair that he'd scavenged from behind a tenement building, he inhaled the scent of the still warm food. The smells of coffee began to drift over from the coffee maker he'd started before putting his clean clothes away. He fished out the small dictionaries and added them to his bookshelf before settling in to eat and think. The loukoumades were a welcome treat and he was going to save them for the coffee when it was ready. He leaned back in the chair, gazing out the window. A few stars were visible over the glow of the city lights, a thin slice of sky between the run-down buildings.

Making a cup of strong Turkish coffee, he nibbled on the loukoumades and sipped the coffee. Contemplating the bargain he’d made. He’d made better deals, tired, hungover, and pressed for time, he'd done his best. The umbral life in the City environs was rarely friendly and very different from most of the places he’d been. Things didn’t look or smell right half the time, although to the locals, it was normal.

"So," he thought to himself, "I have to find a martyr. Not just any one, but a specific marked one. Not knowing a name, a location, or many clues."

"This sucks."

Reminded of his aunt earlier, he thought about the lesson that had come into his mind. Spirits, he knew, were often out of sync with the modern world. Thinking about it, the cockroach spirit he’d spoken with had sounded old. He knew he hadn’t heard actual words, not in the umbra. Instead communication was less direct through symbols and metaphors. His mind filling in details to make it seem like a conversation in the language that he expected to hear. His mind worrying at the thought./Turkish

Recognizing this was important, he stood, setting aside his coffee and plate of treats. Moving into the open space in the empty living area, he slid his body into the opening pose of the Tai Chi long form. He'd learned it to help him meditate when sitting still had proven too difficult at the time. He still used it to let go his thoughts so his mind could work. Slowly moving through the form, his mind began to let go and still. Thoughts and worries slipped away as he moved through the forms. At the end, he allowed himself to drop into a meditative pose, focused on a small rock that sat on his window sill. 

The light had began to fade, when he moved again. He moved slowly into a standing position and reached over his now cold cup of coffee. He reached across the table to the pile of books he'd pulled from his bag. He reached for the English dictionary and began to flip pages. After a moment he stopped, his eyes refocused on what was in his hands. In the pages of the dictionary he saw: 

<i>noun: martyr; plural noun: martyrs
 1. a person who is killed because of their religious or other beliefs. "saints, martyrs, and witnesses to the faith"
 2. a person who displays or exaggerates their discomfort or distress in order to obtain sympathy or admiration. "she wanted to play the martyr"
 3. a constant sufferer from (an ailment). "I'm a martyr to migraines!"

verb: martyr; 3rd person present: martyrs; past tense: martyred; past participle: martyred; gerund or present participle: martyring
 1. kill (someone) because of their beliefs. "she was martyred for her faith"
 2. cause great pain or distress to. "there was no need to martyr themselves again"
 
origin: 
 1. Old English martir, via ecclesiastical Latin from Greek martur ‘witness’ (in Christian use, ‘martyr’).</i>

"So," he thought, "I'm not looking for a dead person, I doubt I'm looking for a whiner. So, either somebody suffering from something or, maybe a witness. A witness to what, though?"

Shifting back to his homid form, he grimaced as he sipped his cold  coffee. He started another cup, reaching for a small notepad and pencil  as he started to think some more and doodle. Greek letters,  hieroglyphics, and primitive stick figures crawled across the paper.  In hindsight, he should have asked if there was a deadline on the  delivery. He did not want any of cockroaches children angry at him or  thinking he would welsh on a deal.

A loud pounding noise echoed through his small apartment. Walking over to the door, he saw Gate-Crasher, arm raised for another pound.

"C'mon Cue-ball, I know you're in there." he called, starting to pound again.

John opened the door before his fist hit it again, asking "What's going on?"

"Grandma and Bubba sent me to find out. One of the cousins saw you earlier so we knew you were back. Something you need to see. Big fight down by the palace. The Black Claw Sept is down hard, one maybe two survivors. Git to the yard now, Grandma says." came out in a quiet rush, "I'm headed out to see if I can help clean up. Maggie was sent to let their caern know we have at least one survivor."

"I'll be on my way." John replied. 

"Best hurry, the cub wasn't really hurt, but the other one was bad ripped up." Gate-Crasher advised, "I'm out of here."

John turned off the coffee pot and grabbed his coat and shoes. It  wasn’t full dark yet, but he could smell the fog coming in. He hurried  down the street,waiting for it to get dark enough and foggy enough to  shift to a faster form. He wasn’t worried about being mugged, although  he’d seem more Dancers here than most places. A Sept or pack of those  would require a quick exit.

Getting to the junkyard, he slid through the barrier maze of cards  and gates that discouraged casual visitors. He nodded at Cooper, who  waved him through. He hustled back to the old office building. Hidden  behind piles of cars, Grandma claimed for wounded or her own projects.  He could see bright lights on in the shop by the side of the yard  claimed by the benders and hear more than one voice. He couldn’t make  out the words, but it didn’t sound good. He saw a handful of people in  towers of cars, the yard was clearly on full alert. The activity  highlighted how big this was. Rushing across the yard, he wondered how many in the few towers of cars were George’s and what they were  packing. Before, the junkyard had seemed like a kid's fort, something  hidden away behind walls of pretend protection. The activity mad it obvious that it was a well planned design.

John passed through the entry and looked in the smaller room in the  back. He could see Grandma shaking her head. Known for her  ability to put people back together, that was not a good sign. He  recognized the form on the bed. The chrinos form was that of one of  Ernest’s people, a Get that ran with Ernest’s pack on a regular basis.  He’d never seen a living form so torn up and still alive. He suspected  that would not be the case for long.

He suspected that would not be the case for long.

"What happened?" John asked.

Before an of the gnawers in the room could answer, the dying werewolf looked at John. Clearly recognizing John's Silent Strider heritage.

"Strider, witness me. Bear word to my kin that I fell in battle." it gasped out in a bloody, rasping voice, "I fell with pack, in battle, staying only to pass word as I was commanded."

"We fought it, the beast from beyond, it stank of the Umbra and it's steps burned Gaia with it's passing. The man in red it was hunting called it the beast, he knew his doom was upon him before we attacked. He fled as we fought, but we did not stop. Flames burned it, our claws and teeth bit it. My pack is gone, my leader felled dealing the killing blow. It laughed, cackled and spoke in strange words as it fought. It stank of blood and pain. We were gathering it's remains and our fallen, to honor them, when it's mate attacked. The rest of us fell, but it was sorely wounded. Witness this to my kin, the blows I dealt were mighty, the damage I took was fought for. There are no blows to my back."

The effort drained the last energy from the dying chrinos, his body collapsed and his final breath was audible.

The room collapsed into silence, the last breath of the chrinos loud in the room. When the howl of grief broke out, John leapt. Realizing it came from a young wolf he didn't recognize. 

Looking at Bubba, he asked, "Who's that"

"The last survivor of a pack." came the quiet reply, "A new cub, they sent him with word, to find a pack from us. We were closer than their own caern. He didn't know the quick route, so we didn't get there for anything but the clean up." 

"Where things cleaned up in time?" John asked. 

"Barely. The Black Men and the Metal Men were there pretty quickly. We got all of the pack bodies out, we got the body of the beast out. It was a close thing though. We were able to slide through the gauntlet to get away. Lots of the spacemen on that side, but we were able to slip away. Cooper's got the body of the beast, we sent Maggie over to their sept to let them know what we've got. She should be getting there soon."

John had never been to Ernest's sept, he knew the proper name of it, the Sept of the Glittering Tower. He also knew that most of the Bone Gnawers called it the Sept of the Cadillac. 

Jackie joined the group. She was still in body armor, with a large satchel hanging from her side and a large gun slung over her shoulder. 

"I'm going to have to talk to Dad about larger calibers." She said, "I don't think the usual would put that beast down. Cooper's got it in a few pieces and that hide was thick and tough. You need to fight one, take a klaive, a big one. Claws will be a tough go."

"Any good news?", he asked.

"Well, a pack can take one down, although from what we've been told, it's at least got some cunning, which makes it tougher." she replied, "I don't think most of Dad's crew would want to fight it on this side of the barrier though. He'd want an RPG, to tackle it. It definitely came through from some where, probably some where deep too. That there's another known one, makes me wonder how many there really are. I spoke to the nerds, they don't think it's anything the other side brought through. They say they're more abuzz than we are about it. Something's caused a weak spot they can slip through is the current thinking." 

Just then, Bites-at-tails hollered from outside, "Cue-ball, there's a call for you at the pay phone."
