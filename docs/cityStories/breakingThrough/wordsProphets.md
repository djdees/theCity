description: "A late night rondevous for Judas"

The fog was thick, even for the City's notoriously thick fog. Judas moved slowly through it, feeling as if he was almost swimming, rather than walking. The dark moonless night, was quiet and the fog further muffled sounds. Slight halos of light at regular intervals marked the gas lamps, although they could not be seen through the water droplets that danced in the dark, and the cobblestones beneath his feet were slippery. .

A sense of unease had begun a short time before, the m
eeting he was rushing to had slipped from his mind, the fog slowing both his progress and thoughts down. He knew it was important that he make the meeting, but the purpose and the person he was to meet with had slipped from his mind, destination and name resting on the tip of his thoughts, but not accessible to him.

Approaching a corner, he paused in the small circle of light cast by the lamp above him. A cold breeze kicked up, causing him to adjust his collar to keep out the cold and damp. The heavy cloak weighed him down, but helped keep the chill from him. Shifting the package in his hand, he reached into his vest pocket, pulling out his pocket watch and flipping open the familiar silvered cover with the death's head on it.

Judas' mind began to sharpen and clear. The ticking of the watch seemed to speed up, from a glacial pace to something that seemed more normal. A quiet tapping began to compete with the ticking of his watch for his attention.  A prickling feeling crawled the length of his thumbs and the feeling of something wrong began to creep through his torso.

"Oh, fuck." he whispered to himself, "This is not good."

The tapping noise was getting louder, coming closer. Panic started to assert it's control over him, but he was rooted to the spot. A flash of light blinded him for a moment, before dimming into the flame from a Zippo lighter. The light highlighted a dark, round face, shadowed from the lamp above by a tall hat with a wide brim. A wilted rose hung from the hatband, drops of fog condensed on the petals. A short, stout body encased in a black suit emerged from the fog beneath it.

"Bonsoir, my petit mal," a deep voice drawled, "What brings you to my crossroads tonight? "

Judas' mind registered several things at once. He realized he was in the old suit, the one he had gotten the last time he saw Joey Tatiano. He realized that he'd never seen cobblestones in the City before, nor gas lamps. He realized he was out without any of his normal tools and protections. These realizations did not give him a good feeling.

"Hmm." the voice continued, not waiting for a reply, "my Baron's mark is on you, but he has not dug for you. Do you seek him with gifts? Do you seek the twins, looking for insight?"

Judas shook his head slowly, disoriented and wondering what was going on.

"Ah, lost I see. A little lamb, ripe for plucking." chuckled the voice, "It is not time for you to meet me at the crossroads. For a gift, perhaps the thing in your hand, I can show you the way. What though, is it you seek? What path for your feet? To the twins to ask? Very dangerous without the right gifts. Perhaps to my brother, his horses are coming, you know. They will meet the wave that comes, to try to blunt it, to turn it. To protect what is ours. I will meet them all, sooner or later."

Judas's mind raced. Panic would get him no where, he thought. Dark foggy streets and blind running without an immediate threat normally lead to more pain. Courage and bravado might work, but so might cunning and politeness. He decided to fall back on politeness, since there'd been no overt threat. Yet.

The package in his hand was wrapped in brown paper, tied with string, and did not weigh very much. The immediate problem with it was that he didn't know what was in the wrapping. He had noticed the subtle hint that it would be the price of getting out of this painlessly.

"Heh, pussy got your tongue?" the voice broke the silence, rougher and coarser than before. "Manners get you far more than the lack of them will."

Judas realized several minutes had passed without him responding. Deciding something was better than nothing, he responded, trying to match the earlier tone of the meeting.

"My apologies," he replied sliding into old manners like he would an old suit. Urbane, he thought to himself, that's the tone.

"A good evening to you as well," he continued, "my mind was slow, trying to think of the best answer to your question."

He decided that he was going to have to give up the package, but that he would do his best to get as much as he could for it. Remembering something he'd read when trying to find some things out about the cane, he patted the pockets of his suit. Unexpectedly, he found a small silver rectangle in his breast pocket and a small flask in his back pocket. Recognizing the flask for what it was, he cringed at the thought of his subconscious having alcohol on it's mind. The rectangle though, he recognized as he pulled it out. A cigar case.

Offering up the flask, he asked, "Would you like some refreshment as we speak, or, perhaps a fresh cigar?"

"Ah, my petit mal," was the reply, "you've begun to learn how to work with us, gift for gift, favor for favor. Save the rum for my baron or his wife, perhaps one of my brothers. A cigar, though, a fresh one would be nice."

Opening the cigar case, desperately hoping there were actually cigars in it, Judas offered it up. The man extracted one cigar and a moment later had it cut and lit.

"Ah, a fine cigar is to be treasured," he said, "Long firm and hot, with a good taste."

"So," he continued, "what's it to be. My time is long, but yours is short and the night, she moves along at her pace. La lune is coming and with her, your friends and foes. My brother, Brave Ghede will be coming to chase you away soon."

"I think," Judas replied, "that I would offer the package in my hand and the rest of my cigars for a safe path home and three answers."

"My, my, how courageux you are," came the laughing reply, "Is the petit growing up to become gran? I would give you a safe path home, deaux pieces of information and un piece of advice."

In the distance, Judas heard the sound of what he thought might be claws on the cobblestones, as the fog seemed to thicken and began to stir.  The slight breeze began to smell of freshly turned dirt and rot.

Determined, Judas tried one more time, "A safe path home, two answers and a piece of good advice."

"So wise, to know advice maybe good or bad." chuckled the figure, "Sagesse and courageux both deserve a reward. Not the best bargaining, but not a bad deal. I will take it I think and, perhaps, just perhaps, we'll do this again. What is your question? But be quick, for time has almost flown"

Judas thought quickly, he'd not expected to really get an answer. Based on his limited research, he knew getting greedy would be not good. To buy time, he offered up the package in his hand and the cigar case.

"Here's my part for you," he said, "for my questions, what's coming and how can we stop it?"

"What's coming, my petit mal, is the mob. They come from the far, far away, seeking a gateway through which they can enter and feed. They hunger for silence, a deeper silence than that of my Baron's domain. As for stopping them, they number as the stars, best to destroy their gateway before Carrefour can open it for them as he opens it for others."

"Crap," Judas thought, "Couldn't these things come with a clear set of instructions at least once?"

"My advice, is watch for my cousin, the Ghede Linto, he smells le problème and can guide you to answers, if you can learn his lessons." the voice continued, "As for the route sûre, go into that building, up to the seventh door on the third floor, knock three times and enter. Now, I'm off to enjoy my pommes and cigars, be on your way, rapidement, my brother approaches."

The fog swirled, the smells grew stronger. Judas realized that he was standing alone on the corner. The building that had been indicated was across the way. He heard the tolling of a large bell echo through the fog. From the street behind him, the clicking of claws on the pavement grew louder, closer. He quickly gathered himself and dashed across the street. He found the door to be unlocked.

Closing the door behind him, he didn't see a lock or anything to bar it with. Deciding haste was the next best thing, he rapidly climbed the stairs to the third floor and exited the stairwell. A long corridor stretched away from him. He could see paired doors down the hallway, one on each side. He counted down to three and paused. He didn't remember being told which side of the hallway to use.

Racking his brain for a clue, he looked closely at each door. While the frames and the doors were virtually identical, he noticed that the glass and brass knobs were decorated differently. The knob on the left was a plant that he didn't recognize the leaves that wrapped around it and the blossom that covered the front of the knob, seemed to be distorted or off. The knob on the right hand door had what appeared to be an apple with two leaves from the stem.

A feeling of dread passed through his body, leaving shudders in his wake. Something wicked was coming, he could feel it and the malevolence almost burned. The bell rang again.

Deciding, he reached out, knocking three times. The door swung open a crack. He pushed it further and stepped through.

There, sitting in front of him at the end of a long rug was his cat. Not one of his kittens, now mostly grown, but his cat. Puzzled, he took a step forward only to have his foot pass through the rug. Off balance, he tumbled down to fall into darkness.

He felt his whole body jump as all his muscles tensed and released at once. He felt a foot hit something, a metallic thunking noise followed. Opening his eyes, he found himself in the old recliner he'd added to his living room after Gillian had left. The cat was sitting at the end of the rug in front of it, watching him intently.

The cat sauntered off, stepping over the fallen walking cane and vanishing under the couch. Idly Judas wondered, if he looked, would the cat be under the couch or not. His mind too unsettled to think about connecting to the cat to see where it really was.

After a moment to let his mind catch up to the changed location, Judas stood up. He passed through the kitchen, grabbing a small bottle of sparkling water. Entering his bedroom, he glanced in the mirror, only to pause. The remaining feeling of disassociation fled as he looked at himself. He was once again in the Victorian suit that he's woken up in before. Now, though, a top hat had been added to the ensemble. The pocket watch chain glinted as it swung beneath the watch pocket and a wilted rose was in the buttonhole.

Judas blindly set down the bottle he had in his hand, only to knock an apple off the nightstand.


He wondered, not for the first time, about reality and if he would find a flask in his back pocket.
