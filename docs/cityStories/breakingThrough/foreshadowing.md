In the quiet of a sunny afternoon, the trunk of a very old, black
Cadillac slammed shut, echoing through the alleyway it was parked in.
Stooping over, Judas picked up a large box filled with art supplies
and began making his way to the back door of the Helping Hand Mission
building.

The call from Karen had been a surprise. He'd not realized how much
time it had been since he had run art classes for the kids and it felt
good to know that the kids had been asking for him to come back. With
the rare sunny day, he thought he'd take advantage of the big windows
and maybe let the kids go crazy with water colors.

As he carried the big box over to the steps to the loading dock door,
a quiet squeaking noise came from behind him. Turning, he saw a rusty
grocery cart piled high moving down the alley towards him. As it got
closer, he heard a greeting.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Mumbles." he called back, "How are things today?"

"Sheet, after all this time, I'm still not a mister any more." came
the reply, "but things aren't too bad today. Better than last week,
that's for sure. Too much commotion, I like the quiet much better.
It's far easier to hear the voices, they've been quiet lately."

Shaking his head, Judas continued up the steps. As he set down his box
to get his key-card out and open the door, he heard one last quiet
line.

"Strange things are sure afoot at the Circle K."
