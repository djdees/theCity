Alas, alas for Babylon!

Judas had heard that two or three times in the past week, once from a talking rat. Not a rat he’d talked to because he was a psychic, not the little spirit he called Rat-In-Pants, but a big, bioluminescent talking dock rat. Sent by Rat, it had said, with a message specifically for Judas. It presumably meant the Rat, the great and powerful spirit that had inexplicably ordered him to take care of a site sacred to werewolves.

Judas was pretty sure he was not suffering from Paradox at the time. In his experience, talking phantom rats were not a symptom of magical insanity, and messages from the Rat should be taken seriously, no matter how they were delivered. He should probably get used to it, he told himself.

Strange things are afoot at the Circle K, the dock rat had told him, bad things on the wind, bad things from far away. Rat has smelled a prophet, somebody who has seen, Find him or find his message. Prepare, prepare so all is not lost. Else it's alas, alas for Babylon, the end of days.

A day or two earlier Judas had heard a new street preacher proclaim something very similar: Alas, alas for Babylon! The days are near, the times are ending!…I am not the prophet, but I have seen his words…Alas poor Babylon, sleeping in ignorance, the prophet ignored. Your days are numbered.

There had been more: Something about a wheel turning, the high becoming the low and vice versa, and something about a mob and eternal silence. And before that, Mr. Mumbles had warned him about the Circle K, in exactly the same words the rat had spoken: Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.

Judas had read the Bible, and even had one, a “souvenir” of a time when he had nothing but time and misery on his hands; his own private limbo. He hadn’t read the Bible for comfort. He’d read it because it was there, and because if he did not distract himself he was consumed with terrifying memories and the knowledge that if he was found, he would die. Horribly.

And so he knew not only the common story of the Tower of Babylon, but that the city popped up down the line in the Scriptures. He could only remember pieces of it: war, exile, God smiting, that sort of thing. Something told him this wasn’t coincidental, that it was important, and impending, that he didn’t have the time to reread the whole book.

At the public library, he found what he needed: a concordance. He took it to a table, sat down, and opened it. He found the entry for “Babylon,” and went methodically through the index, finding and checking every verse in his Bible. Wars with Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, and the Babylonian captivity of the Jews, in Kings, in Chronicles, and in Ezra; the return to Jerusalem from Babylon in Nehemiah; mentions in Psalms; prophesies in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel—of both its victory over Jerusalem and its destruction.

"Getting warmer?" Judas wondered.

At last, something jumped out at him: Revelation 18:10:

"Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come."

Did Rat and the preacher’s warnings mean he was living in Babylon? The City certainly had her fornication and her sins, dwellings for demons and haunts for every impure spirit. And he knew this because he had sipped from her golden cup of abominations, and supped with her whores.

“Great. Another apocalypse,” he muttered, and was immediately shushed by nearby patrons. When he got home, he called the payphone just outside of the junkyard. 

When someone answered, he said, “It’s Judas. I need to talk to John.”

“Which one?” 

“Cue Ball.”

“Hang on. I’ll see if he’s here.”

Judas waited as minutes ticked by, listening to the sound of traffic, roadwork, and pedestrians. Finally, someone returned to the phone.

“Yeah?” he heard John say.

“It’s me,” he replied. “Has anyone talked to you about Babylon lately?”

A long pause. Judas could hear the big machinery starting up again in the background. Lunch time must be over and the afternoon shift starting down near the crusher.

"No, nothing about Babylon." came the slow answer, "but, I am looking for a martyr, seen any signs of one?"

"No, but I know a prophet has been seen around." Judas quickly replied, "This is rapidly starting to sound biblical and not in a good way."

A bit of motion caught Judas's eye. A white headscarf on a tall, thin, androgynous black man walked by. His black shirt and pants stood out under the white jacket that he wore. The long-handled shovel over his shoulder was not attracking the notice it should have. Judas watched the figure continue down the block and around the corner. 

As the figure rounded the corner, a brightly colored van came down the street. Moving easily through traffic, it passed down the street. A chill ran down Judas's spine. 

He recognized the driver. He didn't think he'd forget the round black face, the tall hat. The cigar in the mouth of the man and the apple and rose motif were also familiar.

"Shit," he said. 

"What?" Asked John, "What's going on?"

"I think I just saw an omen, something I'd met in a dream." Judas answered shakily.

### Notes:  
0. Who John is looking for is living between Uh! research, near the dumpster of a parts shop that also sold a lot of electronic components. An older neon sign's surviving tubes form a shape similar to the Garou glyph for the Cockroach Totem.
1. The reward is "a dagger made from a tooth that was from the last dragon he fought.
2. Finding the witness, will shortly summon Ceres and something hunting him. The shape/figure only appears at night and it's face can't be seen. Glowing eyes in amber or red can be seen.
3. Across the street is the Palace, an abandoned theater.
