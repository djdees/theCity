The sidebar lists stories that are more wall of text than I would like. That being said, they're all about the education of Judas in the ways of different world. As an Orphan, he didn't get any of the traditional education that would have come with being part of a Tradtion or Convention. Even the things a sub-group would have given him just weren't there. In addition, the WereWolves see things very differently and are wary of letting information go. I had to figure out how to education the character. Generally, conversations with others was the way it went.

Originally, much of this education was addressed in emails between sessions. None of the other players were very interested in blue-booking sessions. Judas's player though, loved it. The writing continues to this day, otherwise this would be a much smaller and more static section of the web site.
