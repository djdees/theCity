There was a moment of quiet. The scrapper team was off today, so the cranes and the big shredder at the far other end of the junkyard were quiet. Over in the shade made by crushed station wagon propped across two Caravans. Bubba was quietly instructing a young visiting garou in Japanese tea ceremony. Judas had thought his mind boggled the first time he heard Bubba perform as the tale singer. Bubba performing the tea ceremony in chrinos stretched it even further. His mind switched between that image and the image of Bubba, engine of destruction. He wondered how Bubba held the frail tea cups without shattering them. 

A quiet chuckle broke his wandering thoughts and a cold water bottle dropped into his hands. 

"Tough image to swallow?" asked Shiny Bits. 

"Yeah, I know you can't judge a book by its cover," replied Judas, "but where the hell did he learn that, of all things. I've never seen it live, but that looks very real."

"Well," Shiny Bits replied, "you have to remember, Bubba's teenage years were really awkward even by our standards. He really struggled with his strength in his birth form, the homid one."

"I can't tell you how many things got ripped, crushed, torn, or otherwise damaged." he continued, "After about six months of it, everybody knew that something had to be done, but it was not a problem we'd ever had to deal with. Usually stronger is better. Then, he wrecked Grandma's kitchen trying to help."

Judas blinked. 

"Wrecked Grandma's kitchen?" he asked. That was not what he would have expected to be the final straw. 

Shiny Bits chuckled, his eyes lost in the memory for a moment. 

"Yup."

"How did he survive that?" Judas asked. Knowing how the caern felt about her cooking in general, her cookies in particular, he thought dismemberment may have been a real outcome. 

"Barely. George rescued him actually." Shiny Bits answered, "He bribed a few of us to clean the place to Grandma's standards, arranged for her favorite mixing bowl set to be restored to pristine condition, and promised to have Bubba taught to get a ... grip ... on his strength."

Judas groaned, that wasn't that funny, but he'd learned not groaning often got stories cut short. Shiny Bits did think he was funnier than he actually was, at least half the time.

"So, he takes Bubba off, telling him that he'll learn or he won't like the consequences. Bubba won't talk about where he went or what he learned. For the first year he was back, twice a week he was doing the tea ceremony and what he called remedial control exercises. He'd learned to juggle, said he was required to juggle with eggs. Lots of good laughs came from that for a few weeks until he got the hang of it. I don't remember the rest, but he got pretty good." continued the story.

"Then, after a year and a bit back, he and George were gone for a couple of weeks and he came back with a fancy Japanese outfit and that tea set in a wooden box. He's very protective of both. A few moons after that, a young garou wandered in, asked for him by name. Turns out, he was sent to learn the basics of the tea ceremony from Bubba, while in chrinos form. That still happens every few years, this one is just the latest in that chain." Shiny Bits finished the story.

Judas shook his head and wondered if the weirdness was him or the garou in general. After thinking a moment, he decided that boe likely answer. 

"I was thinking," Shiny Bits started, "about your last couple trips into the umbra with us. I hadn't really realized how much you didn't know about and how much I take for granted. I can't tell you everything I know - there's not enough years for that - but I can start you with an overview and, maybe, show you some of the good parts. If, of course, you're interested. I'm not always much of a teacher, but I will do my best."

Judas' mind focused on what he was being offered. Between and beneath the spoken words and offer, he heard other things as well. The lure of knowledge that might help him or save his live one day. The siren song of acceptance echoed in the distance, much like when Cooper had helped him with his yard. He thought carefully, learning more was one thing, experiencing it was a different thing. His terror of what he'd seen across the barrier stayed fresh in his mind. 

"Well," he stalled, "how about we start with what you can tell me and we'll see about the trip later, I don't heal as fast as you do."

Shiny Bits chuckled for a moment. 

"Fair enough." he said, "There's a lot of beauty out in the Umbra, but it can be hard to find or unsafe to get to."

"Let's start at the beginning, in the long-ago, there was no umbra, no shadow, none of that. It was all connected. Then, the one was split in two by the great severing. No one now knows why it happened, there's as many thoughts on that as there are people to think them. The barrier, the gauntlet, went up. The connection between matter and spirit severed by it. For long years a way to destroy the barrier and heal the breach was sought, but not found." he continued.

"Some, the garou among them, retained the ability to move between the two worlds, the world of matter and the world of spirits. Others can do it it as well. Some benders do it with ease, other can't even begin to. There's weak spots in the barrier as well. Here, in this city, it's generally very weak, the wall is thinner with a few more holes than normal." 


"The thing to remember though, is that while still connected by the barrier, the worlds can be very different. Closest to the barrier, they are the most similar, but the immediate other side isn't a reflection, really. Not even a fun house mirror, like some say. Once you cross the barrier, the spirits hold sway. No ifs, ands, or buts about it, the further you get away from the barrier the more they hold sway. Near the barrier, it's the spiritual reflection of what's on this side. You've been deeper in too, seen some of the realms. There's others, places that are not for us, where we can't go or function if we end up there. Much further out is a second lesser barrier that separates the deep reaches from us. Not a place to be found for the likes of us. Remember, what determines what appears just past the barrier is spiritual weight. Here, the new skyscraper. You cross the barrier and in it's place you'll see the cathedral that stood there for more than a century. Torn down, but the weight of it, still stands there. I doubt the offices will ever displace it, although it will fade with time. A street, not even a track in the trees. The expressway? Well, that's a trail. Again, it's spiritual weight of it."

"We move back and forth because it's our nature. You've noticed that while we aren't benders, we have, gifts. Things we can do because we are garou, the defenders of Gaia. Many of the things we can do, we learn from spirits, always for a price. Honor, reputation, and how we keep deals are all judged by spirits. Barter and favors are how business is done. Like all things, spirits have their allies, their enemies, and their kin. It's similar, yet different than people in that way." 


"I don't know, really, how benders cross. I know there's more than one way for them, but that is about it. Even we have a few ways, although we each have a favorite. We start teaching the cubs with a large reflective surface. A mirror here in the city, although there are other ways. The stronger the barrier, the harder it is. That's one reason the cubs avoid my squat. All the reflective surfaces are tough for them. I even once defeated a dancer with a disco ball and a trick. Took me forever to get my shadow back though."

"Since we've a bit tonight, then things to do, I'm just going to give you a short overview." Shiny Bits started, "George and the other mages use some different words, but I'll use what I know. I'll say it again, it's different for Benders, really, it's different for each Bender, from what I can tell. I'll talk about things, but you'll want to find out from others how they see it. What you see, will fit the common themes, but will be your own as well. Garou see the main places pretty much the same, because we're part of it. We're as strongly in the spiritual world as the physical world."

He continued on, "First, there's crossing the Gauntlet, the barrier that I spoke about a moment ago. It can be a challenge and the unlucky or the unwary can become stuck waiting for whatever or whoever finds them. The weaker the gauntlet, the easier the crossing. You've only crossed in this area, that I know of. Your fetish, the cane, works here. I'd be cautious trying other places. Not only might it not work, it might not work right or you might not like where you land. Crossing here, you cross into our bawn, an area we patrol and protect. Other places may, or may not, be less safe. Also, from here, we can access the moon bridges. For us, they are a safer route to parts of the umbra. The weaker places, especially the weakest, are also often places where spiritual energy is strong. Many benders seek to gather this power for their own purposes, not the good of Gaia. We defend them where we know of them. It's rarely pretty, since most don't really like to be told no. Odds are good, you'll one day have to help us defend this spot or defend the new spot that you and Ramsey have been gifted. Not just mages, but any of those that have fallen to the wyrm will seek them out to try to control them and turn them to their own purposes. Even other packs or tribes that covet it for their own."

Taking a sip of his beer, Shiny Bits paused for a moment. 


"I'm going to continue on, working from here out, sort of. Once we're through the Gauntlet, we're in the Penumbra. It's the most directly dangerous, banes of all sorts dwell there. Spirits too, travel it and live it. Luna lights it and her phase here matches her phase there. The brighter she is, the brighter it is. The energies of the the triat, the Wyrm, the Weaver, and the Wyld all are manifest. As I said before, it's spiritual weight that counts, just just mere physical existence. Not just places, but individuals can be seen there. We find many other things too. Blights, where toxins and evils bleed over, many degrees worse are the hellholes. Here in the city, all these can be found."


"There's also the weaver, you've seen some of that as we've passed through. All those webs you see on buildings, traces of the weaver. The more technology, the more built, the more the weaver has worked on it. That's reflected in the penumbra as well. There, the webs are laid by pattern spiders, net-spiders, and many of the Weaver's children. One story is that the weaver moved to lock everything in it's web, static and unmoving. The Wyrm was a check on the weaver and went crazy trying to keep up. The Wyld can't keep up with both and with the rise of man, we're where we are today. The Weaver trying to lock things down, the Wyrm - insane and corrupt - trying to destroy it all, the Wyld trying to keep up with both and stay free, and Gaia, the battle ground, trying to survive as the Triad spins off its wheels. Garou are much like antibodies for Gaia, warring against the minions of the Wyrm and Weaver."


"Mages are there too. Some, caught in the web of Weaver. Other, caught in the madness of the Wyld or the corruption of the Wyrm. Others, who knows. We, here, recognize that and have banded with those that have like minds and goals. Other tribes, other caerns and packs just seem them as tools of Wyrm or abuses of Gaia and her gifts. Things to be culled to prevent worse."


"There are many other types of places that are found. Among the most perilous are the chimares, small dream realms, that exist between and around the near Umbra. Garou can use their dreams to travel, although it's a dangerous path deep into the Umbra, to the border of the near and deep Umbras. Small realms driven by benders can also appear, following their own rules. You and John, I've heard visited one. Do the songs from it still echo in your head?"


Judas shook his head sharply once, then again. Then he sighed. 


"Not until now. I'd managed to get that disco out of my mind." Judas began. 

He continued, "I did track Lola down once, not in person, but with my mind. I know she came out, but not much more."

Shiny Bits chuckled, "Seeking your dancing queen? Perhaps in the throes of Saturday night fevers you will find her again, traveling through delirium. Beware though, talk to other benders, learn the perils peculiar to benders. The only constant across the way is change. All is individual and the deeper you go the more that's true. We deal with totems, spirits, and chimerage, we're part spirit ourselves, it awakens in us when our first change happens and is a constant for us. Benders are different. Some are similar to us, some are very different. Knowledge is power."


"We've chatted long enough about this, later I'll tell you of the near umbra and it's 13 great realms. You've seen at least three of them. The great abyss, the Battleground, and the world that was before. There's great and there's terrible out there. You and I will see a bit more of the City than you have till now and then walk the spirit tracks out to see the wonderful. We have to beware, because wonderful and terrible are often two sides of the same coin."


Shiny Bits finished the cup of mystery liquid he was drinking and stood up.


"I've gotta run now, places to go, things to see." he said, "Catch you later."


Judas sat in thought for a few moments. The thought of seeing things was tempting, but the dangers - both hinted at and known - made it a fearful contemplation.
